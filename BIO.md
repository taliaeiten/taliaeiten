 Hi, I’m @taliaeiten
- I am a graphic design student at the University of Massachusetts Dartmouth. Art has always played an important part in my life, in fact much of my family are artists. It was not until Junior year of high school that I became interested in the world of graphic design. I started with designing digital collages, which is still my favorite style of art.

You can contact me through my instagram @taliaeiten or by email taliaeiten@gmail.com
